# rust-examples

This repository contains a number of Rust programs that I wrote as part of my
personal learning of the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

Most of the programs are derived from examples in _Programming Rust, Second
Edition_ by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora F.S. Tindall (O'Reilly).
