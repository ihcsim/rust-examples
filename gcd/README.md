# gcd

This is a Rust program to compute the
[greatest common divisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor)
of a list of numbers, using
[Euclid's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_algorithm). It is
based on the example in _Programming Rust, Second Edition_
by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff, and Leonora F.S. Tindall (O'Reilly).

I wrote this program as part of my personal learning of the
[Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).
